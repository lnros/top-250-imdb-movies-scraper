Author: Leonardo N. Rosenberg | @lnros 


## Comparing time efficiency of *requests* and *grequests*
Checking how handling concurrency well can improve time efficiency in your code using web scraping as an example.

This code extracts title and director's name for each movie using both methods and compares their execution time.

The webpage used for scraping is: [https://www.imdb.com/chart/top?ref_=nv_mv_250][https://www.imdb.com/chart/top?ref_=nv_mv_250].

### Usage
From the command line
```bash
$ python main.py
```
